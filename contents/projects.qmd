<summary><h2>Cleaning and Hail Protection System for Solar Panels</hs></summary>


**University of Trento** â€“ Master's Degree in Mechatronics Engineering  
**Group members**: Filippo Avi, Alberto Giora, Matteo Manzini, Edoardo Murgia, Andrea Silvan  
**Supervisor**: Prof. Emiliano Rustighi  
**Academic Year**: 2023/2024  
**Course**: Mechanical Design for Mechatronics

### Overview

We developed a multifunctional system to protect photovoltaic panels from hail and ensure optimal performance through autonomous cleaning. The solution integrates a retractable anti-hail net and a rolling brush cleaning mechanism, both actuated by a shared motor-transmission unit.

### Key Features

- Automatic hail detection using a laser disdrometer sensor (ZDM-100)  
- Rolling shutter and cleaning brush powered by a single electric motor  
- Stress and motion analysis of shafts and gear train  
- Finite Element Analysis (FEM) for mechanical verification  
- Low-maintenance design, easy installation on standard panel arrays  
- Water-resistant and IP67-rated components

### Skills Applied

- Mechanical design (CAD, FEM, shaft and gear sizing)  
- Mechatronic integration (sensor-actuator coupling)  
- System simulation and power transmission analysis  
- Team collaboration and report writing (80+ page technical report)
